            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>When the deadline for a huge project is right around the corner, you may need a big crew to finish on time. The
                    rest of the time, having one painter working alone on your project has a lot of advantages. Here are a few:

                    <h5>Keeps Costs Low</h5>
                    <p>With smaller operations, it's easier to keep costs low (a lot of the time). We both save money this way.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Increased Accountability</h5>
                    <p>Each new addition to a team will have more of a challenge in being efficient than the 
                        last guy. This can lead to miscommunication, unaligned standards, 
                        and a chaotic environment that leads to mistakes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Consistent Results</h5>
                    <p>Having one person see the project through from start to finish is the best way to make sure that everything ends up with a 
                    consistent, clean, uniform look. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>More Organized</h5>
                    <p>With one person using the tools, there is no need for excess and it's easier to keep track of where everything is,
                        keeping things efficient. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Quiet and nondisruptive</h5>
                    <p>While crews are fast, they can also be quite intrusive to your
                        space. With one person paiting, often you forget they're even there.
