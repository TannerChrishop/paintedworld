                    <br><br>
                    <h5>Smaller busineses keep costs low</h5>
                    <p>With smaller operations, it's easier to keep costs low (a lot of the time). We both save money this way.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Dedicated to quality and customer satisfaction</h5>
                    <p>The brand stands for a commitment to elegance and striving to work with everyone to meet and surpass
                        their expectations.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Accountability & consistent Results</h5>
                    <p>Working in a crew can lead to miscommunication and unaligned standards. One painter means a 
                        consistent finish everwhere and a single source of responsibility. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Quiet and nondisruptive</h5>
                    <p>While crews are fast, they can also be quite intrusive to your
                        space. With one person paiting, often you forget they're even there.
